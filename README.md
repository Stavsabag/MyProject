# MyProject
Data Science and Machine Learning
Project Description:

This project focuses on collecting data from the Twitter API and leveraging machine learning techniques to classify various problems. By utilizing the Twitter API, a large volume of data is gathered, which is then processed to extract relevant information. The collected data is subjected to data preprocessing steps such as cleaning, feature extraction, and transformation.

Once the data is preprocessed, machine learning techniques are applied to build classification models. These models are trained to classify different problem categories based on the extracted features. The project explores various machine learning algorithms and evaluates their performance to identify the most effective approach.

By combining data collection, preprocessing, and machine learning classification, this project aims to provide insights and predictions related to the identified problems. It offers a systematic and data-driven approach to tackle real-world challenges using Twitter data.
